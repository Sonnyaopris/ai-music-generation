Usage
-----

midi_AI_generare_muzica.ipynb — MIDI-based generation
-----------------------------------------------------
Description:
Trains an LSTM model on sequences of notes extracted from MIDI files and generates new compositions based on the selected genre.

Steps:
1. The MIDI files were manually organized by genre in the /data/midi/ directory.
2. Run the notebook step by step:
   - MIDI preprocessing
   - LSTM model training
   - New sequence generation

3. Output:
   - Automatically generated .mid file
   - Converted to .wav using FluidSynth

4. Visualization:
   - Spectrogram of the generated fragment

mfcc_fma_proiect_psv.ipynb — MFCC-based generation (Audio)
----------------------------------------------------------
Description:
Trains a simple RNN network to generate audio based on MFCC coefficients extracted from music fragments.

Steps:
1. The FMA Small dataset was used. It can be downloaded from:
   https://github.com/mdeff/fma

2. Run the notebook:
   - MFCC extraction
   - LSTM model training
   - Generation of new MFCC sequences

3. Output:
   - Reconstructed .wav audio file from the generated MFCCs

4. Visualization:
   - Spectrogram of the generated audio

Dataset Sources
---------------
- FMA Small Dataset: https://github.com/mdeff/fma
- MIDI dataset: manually curated and organized by genre using publicly available files
